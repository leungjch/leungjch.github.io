E.g. `abs(x)`, `x^2`, `10^(1/4)`. \n\n- When there are multiple answers, enter them separated by a comma.\n- **Mobius only allows multiplication using the multiplication symbol.** For example, `2*x` is allowed, but not `2x`. \n\n# Bonus Quiz 3: How RSA is used in TLS \n**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: The cryptographic protocol used to secure data transmitted between web browsers and websites. \n\n**Symmetric Key Encryption**: \n1. Alice usees a secret key $k$ to encrypt the plaintext $M$. She sends the resulting ciphertext $C$ to Bob.\n2. Bob uses the same secret key $k$ to decrypt $C$ and recovers $M$. \n3. Here, $k$ is a secret key that only Alice and Bob know.\n4. Most commonly Symmetric-key encryption scheme: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). \n5. **PROBLEM**: How to share $k$ securely?\n\n**SOLUTION**: Use RSA public key encryption (1977).\n1. Alice obtains Bob's RSA public key $(e,n)$.\n2. Alice selects a secret key $k$ at random.\n3. Slice computes $c=k^e \\; mod \\; n$ and sends $c$ to Bob.\n4. Bob decrypts $c$ to get $k=c^d \\; mod \\; n$. \n\nRSA is slower than AES encryption but RSA encryption is fast since $k$ is a small message, up to 256 bits in length\n\nQuestion: How does Alice obtain an authentic copy of Bob's public key $(n,e)$? \n\n# 1.2 Sets\n> Definition **Set**: A **set** is a well-defined, unordered collection of distinct objects. Each object that appears in this collection is called an element (or member) of the set. \n\nExamples of sets:\n- $\\{2, 4, 6, 8\\}$ is the set of all positive even numbers less than 10\n- The **natural numbers** is denoted by $\\mathbb{N}= \\{1,2,3, ...\\}$.\n- The set of **integers** is denoted by $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\\}$. \n- The **non-negative integers** are denoted by $N \\cup \\{0 \\}$\n- The set of **rational numbers** is denoted by $\\mathbb{Q} = \\frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. \n- The set of **irrational numbers** are denoted by $\\mathbb{\\bar{Q}}$. Examples include $\\sqrt{2}, \\pi, e$, etc.\n- The set of **real numbers** is denoted by $\\mathbb{R}$ and contains all numbers in decimal form.\n\n\n# 1.3 Mathematical Statements and Negation\n> Definition **Statement**: A statement is a sentence that is either **true** or **false**.\nFor example:\n- $2 + 3 = 6$ (true)\n- $\\pi + 2 \\geq 5$ (true)\n- $\\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number (false)\n\n> Definition **Negation**: Suppose $A$ is a statement. Then the **negation** of $A$ is $\\neg A$. When $A$ is true, then $\\neg A$ is false, and vice versa.\n\nNote that $\\neg (\\neg A)\\equiv A$, that is, they are **logically equivalent**.\n\nExamples of mathematical statements **[TEST]**:\n- $\\pi = 0$\n- 1 = 2\n- There is a least natural number.\n- All even numbers are prime.\n\nExamples of non-mathematical statements **[TEST]**:\n- Is 9 even? (*questions cannot be statements*)\n- $n^2 = 9$ (*open sentence, domain unspecified*)\n- The line with equation $y = mx + b$ crosses the $x$-axis (*open sentence*). \n\n# 1.4 Quantifiers and Quantified Statements\nThe statements\n$$\n\\text{1. For all integers } n \\geq 5:\n\\\\\n2^n > n^2\n\\\\\n\\text{2. There exists at least one integer a such that}\n\\\\\na^2 + 29a + 209 \\leq 0\n\\\\\n$$\nare **quantified statements**. A quantified statement:\n- Involve a variable ($n, a$, etc)\n- A domain, a special set of numbers\n- An open sentence\n- A quantifier ($\\forall$ and $\\exists$): How many elements are claimed to make the open sentence true\n\n**Open sentence**: a sentence where the truth of the sentence is not known. It can be made true or false with more information (e.g. specifying a variable). Inequalities are open sentences. E.x. $4y + 5 = 3$. \n\n**Universal quantifier** (for all $\\forall$): True for all\n\n**Existential quantifier** (there exists $\\exists$): True for at least one\n\n\n## Quantified Statements\n**Universally quantified statement**: \n$$ \\forall x \\in S, P(x) $$\nMeans \"for all $x$ in $S$, $P(x)$ is true\". \n\n**Existentially quantified statement**: \n$$ \\exists x \\in S, P(x) $$\nMeans \"There exists at least one value of $x$ in $S$ for which $P(x)$ is true.\n\nThe quantifier is **universal** or **existential**, the variable is **$x$**, the domain is $S$, the open sentence is $P(x)$. \n\n## Negation of Quantifiers\n### Negating Universal quantifier\n$$ \\neg(\\forall x \\in S, P(x)) \\equiv (\\exists x \\in S, \\neg P(x)) $$\n**Interpretation**: The negation of \"for all $x \\in P(x)$ is true\", will be \"there exists some $x \\in S$ for which $P(x)$ is false\".\n\n\n### Negating Existential quantifier\n$$\\neg(\\exists x \\in S, P(x)) \\equiv (\\forall x \\in S, \\neg P(x))$$\n**Interpretation**: Negation of \"there exists some $x \\in S$ such that $P(x)$ is true\" will be \"for all $x \\in S, P(x)$ is false\". \n\n# 1.5 Nested Quantifiers\n## Two quantifiers\n### Universal + Existential\n$$ \\forall s \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\exists t \\in \\mathbb{R}, t > s $$\n\nRead from left to right: \"For all real numbers $s$, there exist some $t$ such that $t > s$. \n\n**Order matters**: Consider if the quantifiers were switched:\n$$ \\exists t \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\forall s \\in \\mathbb{R}, t > s $$\n\nThis is stating that \"there exists some real $t$ such that $t$ is greater than $s$ for all reals. This is not true since $s$ can easily be $t+1$, which falsifies the statement.\n\nTherefore:\n$$ \\forall x \\in X, \\exists y \\in Y, Q(x,y)  \\\\ \\neq \\\\\n   \\exists y \\in Y, \\forall x \\in X, Q(x,y)\n$$\n\n### Universal + Universal\nSwitching the order of two universal quantifiers is logically equivalent. It doesn't matter if we select $x \\in X$ before $y \\in Y$ or vice versa.\n\n$$ \\forall x \\in X, \\forall y \\in Y, Q(x,y)  \\\\ \\equiv \\\\\n   \\forall y \\in Y, \\forall x \\in X, Q(x,y)\n$$\n\n### Existential + Existential\nSwitching order of existential quantifies is also logically equivalent. It doesn't matter whether we select $x \\in X$ or $y \\in Y$ first. \n\n$$ \\exists x \\in X, \\exists y \\in Y, Q(x,y)  \\\\ \\equiv \\\\\n   \\exists y \\in Y, \\exists x \\in X, Q(x,y)\n$$\n\n## Arbitrary number of quantifiers\nTo read statements with an arbitary number of quantifiers, read from left to right and consider everything after the quantifier as an open sentence (which itself may contain more quantifiers and open statements). This gives us nested \"layers\":\n$$ \\exists x \\in X, (\\forall y \\in Y, (\\exists z \\in Z, R(x,y,z))) $$\n\nThis can be represented as:\n\n$$ \\begin{cases} \n\\exists x \\in X, P(x)) & \\\\\n\\text{where P(x) is} \\> \\forall y \\in Y, Q(x,y) \\\\\n\\text{where Q(x,y) is} \\> \\exists z \\in Z, R(x,y,z)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n## Negation of nested quantifiers\nNegating nested quantifiers is straightforward when we negate layer-by-layer from left to right.\n\nWhen negating a statement, \n- Every universal quantifier $\\forall$ is replaced with existential quantifier $\\exists$. \n- Every existential quantifier $\\exists$  is replacced with universal quantifier $\\forall$. \n- Every open sentence $R(k,p,q)$ is replaced with $\\neg (k,p,q)$. \n\n### Number theory example 1: Goldbach's conjecture\n**Goldbach's conjecture (1742)**: Every integer greater than 2 an be written as a sum of two primes. Represented as a universally quantified statement:\n$$ \\forall k \\in \\mathbb{N}_2, \\exists p, q, \\in \\mathbb{P}, 2k=p+q\n$$\nWhere $\\mathbb{N}_2$ is the set of all integers greater than 1, and $\\mathbb{P}$ is the set of all primes.\n\nNegating Goldbach's conjecture:\n\n$$ \\neg (\\forall k \\in \\mathbb{N}_2, \\exists p, q, \\in \\mathbb{P}, 2k=p+q)\n\\\\ \\equiv \\\\\n\\exists k \\in \\mathbb{N}_2, \\neg(\\exists p, q, \\in \\mathbb{P}, 2k=p+q)\n\\\\ \\equiv \\\\\n\\exists k \\in \\mathbb{N}_2, \\forall p, q, \\in \\mathbb{P}, \\neg(2k=p+q)\n\\\\ \\equiv \\\\\n\\exists k \\in \\mathbb{N}_2, \\forall p, q, \\in \\mathbb{P}, 2k \\neq p+q\n$$\nTo disprove Goldbach's conjecture, we would have to show that the above is true - *there exists an integer $k$ larger than one such that for all primes $p$ and $q$, $2k \\neq p + q$*. \n\n### Number theory example 2: Waring's Problem\n**Waring's problem (1770)**: *For every positive integer $k$, there exists a positive integer $s$ such that every positive integer is the sum of $s$ non negative integers to the power of $k$.* For example, for $k=2$, we can let $s=4$, i.e. every positive integer can be written as a sum of four perfect squares (e.g. $6 = 0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2$).\n\nFormulating Waring's problem as a universally quantified statement:\n$$\n\\forall k \\in \\mathbb{N}^+, \\exists s \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+, \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}^+, \\exists x_1,x_2,x_3 \\in \\mathbb{N}_0, n=x_1^k+x_2^k ... x_s^k\n$$\nIts negation is:\n\n$$\n\\exists k \\in \\mathbb{N}^+, \\forall s \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+, \\exists n \\in \\mathbb{N}^+, \\forall x_1,x_2,x_3 \\in \\mathbb{N}_0, n\\neq x_1^k+x_2^k ... x_s^k\n$$\nWaring's problem was proved in 1909. Therefore, its negation is false.\n\n### Number theory example 3: Fermat's Last Theorem\n**Fermat's Last Theorem**: *For every integer $n$ larger than $2$, the equation $x^n + y^n = z^n$ has no solutions in positive integers x,y, and z.*\n\nIts universally quantified statement is therefore:\n$$\n\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}^{2+}, \\forall x,y,z, \\space x^n + y^n \\neq z^n\n$$\nAnd its negation will be:\n$$\n\\exists n \\in \\mathbb{N}^{2+}, \\exists x,y,z, \\space x^n + y^n = z^n\n$$\nFermat's Last Theorem was proven true in 1995. Therefore, the negation of Fermat's Last Theorem must be false.\n\n\n# 2.1 Truth Tables and Negation\n> Definition [not, negation]: The truth value \"**not** $A$\" is denoted by $\\neg A$ and shown as the truth table below:\n> \n> |$A$|$\\neg A$|\n>  |-|-|\n>  |T|F|\n>  |F|T|\n\n\n**Statement variable**: A symbol in a truth table.\n\nUseful fact: The negation of the negation of $A$ is the same as $A$.\n$$\n\\neg (\\neg A)A \\equiv A\n$$\n\n# 2.2 Conjunction and Disjunction\n**AND** and **OR**\n\n> Definition [compound, component]: A **compound statement** is a statement composed of multiple individual statements, each of which is **component statement**.\n\n> Definition [and, conjunction]: Let $A$ and $B$ be two statements. The truth value of $A$ **AND** $B$, also known as $A \\wedge B$ is defined by the truth table\n>\n> |$A$|$B$|$A \\wedge B$|\n> |-|-|-|\n> |T|T|T|\n> |T|F|F|\n> |F|T|F|\n> |F|F|F|\n>\n> $A \\wedge B$ is also known as the **conjunction** of $A$ and $B$.\n\n> Definition [or, disjunction]: The truth value of $A$ **OR** $B$, also written as $A \\vee B$ is defined by the truth table\n> \n> |$A$|$B$|$A \\vee B$|\n> |-|-|-|\n> |T|T|T|\n> |T|F|T|\n> |F|T|T|\n> |F|F|F|\n\n\nExample (**and**): \nDetermine whether the universally quantified statement is true:\n\nFor all real numbers $x$, $x^2 \\geq 0$ and $sin^2x + cos^2x = 1$\n\nSolution: \n\nThis can be symbollically written as\n$$\n\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}, (x^2 \\geq 0) \\wedge (sin^2x + cos^2x = 1)\n$$\n\nThe conjunction is only true when its components are both true. We know both components are true, therefore the statement is true.\n\nExample (**or**):\nFor all real numbers $x$, $x^2 \\leq 0$ or $x \\geq 0$.\nSymbollically, we write this as:\n$$\n\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}, (x^3 \\leq 0) \\vee (x \\geq 0)\n$$\nThe statement is **true**. It is saying **either** $x^3 \\leq 0$ or $x \\geq 0$. When $x \\leq 0$, we see $x^3 \\leq 0$ is true, and when $x > 0$, the component $x \\leq 0$ is true.\n\n\n# 2.3 Logical Operators and Algebra\nBrackets specify order of operations. For example, to determine $\\neg (A \\wedge B)$, consider $A \\wedge B$ and then apply negation $\\neg$.\n\n> Definition [De Morgan's Laws]: For statement variables $A$ and $B$, we have:\n>\n> $\\neg (A \\wedge B) \\equiv (\\neg A) \\vee (\\neg B)$\n> \n> $\\neg (A \\vee B) \\equiv (\\neg A) \\wedge (\\neg B)$\n\n\n## Commutative/associative/distributive laws\n> **Commutative laws**:\n>\n> $A \\wedge B \\equiv B \\wedge A \\\\$\n> $A \\vee B \\equiv B \\vee A \\\\$\n>\n> **Associative laws**:\n> \n> $A \\wedge (B \\wedge C) \\equiv (A \\wedge B) \\wedge C \\\\$\n> $A \\vee (B \\vee C) \\equiv (A \\vee B) \\vee C \\\\$\n>\n> **Distributive laws**:\n>\n> $A \\wedge (B \\vee C) \\equiv (A \\wedge B) \\vee (A \\wedge C) \\\\$\n> $A \\vee (B \\wedge C) \\equiv (A \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee C) \\\\$\n\n## Transitivity\nIf $S_1 \\equiv S_2$ and $S_2 \\equiv S_3$, then $S_1 \\equiv S_3$. This is known as the **transitivity** of logical equivalence.\n\n## Proof by truth tables vs proof by Boolean laws\nAs the number of statements $n$ increases, the number of entries in a truth table increases exponentially by $2^n$. E.g. 4 statements would require 16 rows.\n\n**Use properties of boolean algebra when**:\n1. There are many statements\n2.

If $P(x)$ is proven for $x$, then it must hold true for any element of $S$ then.\n\n### Examples\nProve $\\forall x \\in R, x^2+1\\geq 2x$\n\n**Proof**: Let $x$ be a real number. Then $x-1$ must also be a real number, hence $(x-1)^2\\geq 0$. Expanding the terms on the left side, we obtain $x^2-2x+1\\geq 0$. Adding $2x$ to both sides we get $x^2+1\\geq 2x$.\n\n### Counterxamples\n> Proof method [counterexample]: To disprove the universally quantified statement $\\forall x \\in S, P(x)$, find an element $x \\in S$ for which the open sentence $P(x)$ is false. This is called **finding a counterexample.**\n\n## Proving Implications\n> Proof method [proving implications]: To prove an implication:\n>\n> 1. Assume the hypothesis is true\n> 2. Show conclusion is true\n\n\n### Even and odd\n> Definition [even, odd]: An integer is even if it is of the form $2k$ where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and odd if $2k+1$.\n\nExample: Prove for all integers $a$, if $a$ is odd, then $3a^2+4a-1$ is even. \n\nProof: Let $a$ be an arbitrary integer, and assume $a$ is odd is true. Then, $a=2k+1$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. To show that $3a^2+4a-1$, we need to find $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $3a^2+4a-1 = 2l$. We thus obtain:\n$$\n3a^2+4a-1 = 3(2k+1)^2 + 4(2k+1)-1 \\\\\n= 2(6k^2+10k+3)\n$$\nLet $l = 6k^2+10k+3$. Then we obtain $3a^2+4a-1 = 2l$.\nHence, $3a^2+4a-1$ is even.\n\n## Divisibility of Integers\n> Definition [divides, divisor, factor, multiple, divisible by]: An integer $m$ **divides** an integer $n$ (written as $m | n$) if there exists an integer $k$ so tat $n = km$. If $m | n$, then $m$ is a **divisor** or a **factor** of $n$, and that $n$ is a multiple of $m$ or that $n$ is **divisible** by $m$. If $m$ does not divide $n$, then $m \\nmid n$. \n\nExamples: \n- 3 | 6 since $6 = 3*2$. There exists $k$ s.t. $6=3k$. \n- $5 \\nmid 6$ since no integer $k$ exists s.t. $6 = 5k$.\n- For all integers $a$, $a | 0$ since $0 = 0 * a$. It's true that $0 | 0$. \n- $1|b$ and $-1|b$ are all true.\n\n## Transitivity of Integers\n> Transitivity of integers: If $a|b$ and $b|c$, then $a|c$.  \n> \n\n> Definition [divisibility of integer combinations (DIC)]: For all integers $a,b,c$, if $a|b$ and $a|c$, then for all integers $x,y$, $a|(bx+cy)$.\n>  \n> Note: The converse is true -  If $a|(bx+cy)$ then $a|b$ and $a|c$. \n\nExample: $(10 * 3) + (15 * 4) = 90$ is divisible by $5$. In fact, $10x + 15y$ is divisible by $5$. \n\n> Divisibility facts:\n> \n> 1. if $a|b$ and $a|c$, then $a|(b+c)$\n> 2. If $a|b$ then $a|bc$ for all integers $c$\n> 3. If $a|b$ and $b|c$ then $a|c$.\n\n**However:**\nThe statement: if $a|(b+c)$ then $a|b$ and $a|c$ is **false**.\n\nIf $d|ac$ and $d|bc$ then $d|c$ is a false statement .\n\nIf $ac|bc$ then $a|b$ is a false statement.\n\n## Proof by contrapositive\n> Proof method [contrapositive]: To prove $A \\Longrightarrow B$, replace it with its contrapositive $(\\neg B) \\Longrightarrow (\\neg A)$\n\n\nExample:\nProve if $x^5 - 3x^4 + 2x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 1 \\geq 0$, then $x \\geq 0$. \n\nLet $x$ be an arbitrary real number. Then prove its contrapositive:\nIf $x < 0$, then $x^5 - 3x^4 + 2x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 1 < 0$.\n\nThen assume $x < 0$. Then $x^5 < 0, 2x^3 < 0, 4x < 0$. We also know $-3x^4 < 0, $-x^2 < 0, and -1 < 0$. Therefore, the entire sum is less than 0.\n\n**Use contrapositive when the conclusion appears simpler than the hypothesis**. \n\n**Use contrapositive when the conclusion is a disjunction** (**or** / $\\vee$ ), since this is $A \\Longrightarrow B \\vee C$, then the contrapositive is $(\\neg B) \\wedge (\\neg C) \\Longrightarrow \\neg A$. Which we obtain from applying De Morgan's Law on an equivalent form of the implication $A \\vee \\neg B$\n\n**When the operations involved are too hard to deal with directly** ($a \\neq b$ or $a \\nmid b$)\n\n# 3.6 Proof by Contradiction\n> Definition [contradiction]: Let $A$ be a statement. Then either $A$ or $\\neg A$ is false, so $A \\wedge (\\neg A)$ is always false. The statement \"$A \\wedge (\\neg A)$ is true\" is called a contradiction. \n\n## Example of proof by contradiction\nProve that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\nProof approach: Express $\\sqrt{2}$ as the ratio of two integers, then show that by contradiction, both of these integers must be even, which shows that $\\sqrt{2}$ cannot be represented as the ratio of two integers. \n\n## Disproving implications by contradiction\nExample: Prove for $a,b,c$, if $a | (b+c)$ and $a \\nmid b$ then $a \\nmid c$. \n\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that there exists integers $a,b,c$ such that $a|(b+c)$ and $a \\nmid b$ and $a |c$. By DIC with $x=1$ and $y=-1$, we have\n$$\na|(1 * (b+c) + -1c) \\\\\na|b\n$$\nWhich is a contradiction to the initial assumptions $a\\nmid b$. This is a contradiction, so the statement is true. \n\n**Contradiction and contrapositive are similar in logical structure.** \n\n## Proving Uniqueness\n> Proof method [uniqueness]: \n> \n> Step 1 **(Existence)**: Prove that there is at least one element $x \\in S$ such that $P(x)$ is true. That is, prove $\\exists x \\in S, P(x)$. \n> \n> Step 2 **(Uniqueness)**: Do either of the two:\n>\n> 1. Assume $P(x)$ and $P(y)$ are true for $x,y \\in S$ and prove that this assumption leads to the conclusion $x=y$. \n> 2. Assume that $P(x)$ and $P(y)$ are true for $x,y \\in S$ so $x\\neq y$, and prove that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\n# 3.7 Proving If and Only if Statements\n\n> Proof method [if and only if]: To prove an iff statement:\n> \n> 1. To prove $A \\Leftrightarrow B$, it is equivalent to prove $A \\Longrightarrow B$ and its converse $B \\Rightarrow A$. \n> 2. To prove the universally quantified statement $\\forall x \\in S, P(x) \\Leftrightarrow Q(x)$, then do either:\n> 6\n> a) Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $S$, and prove $P(x) \\Longrightarrow Q(x)$ and its converse $Q(x) \\Longrightarrow P(x)$ \n> b) Prove the universally quantified implication $\\forall x \\in S, P(x) \\Longrightarrow Q(x)$ and its universally quantified converse $\\forall x \\in S, Q(x) \\Longrightarrow P(x)$ \n\n## Example of proving iff statements\nProve: For all integers $a,b,c$ we have $a|b|$ and $a|c$ if and only if for all integers $x,y$, $a|(bx+cy)$. \n\nTo prove this statement, we need to prove the universally quantified implication and its converse. We previously proved both of these true, so the iff statement is true.\n\n# 4.1 Notation for Summations, Products, Recurrences\n## Notation for Summations\n> Definition [Summation notation]:\n> $$\\sum_{i=m}^n x_i $$\n>\n> Represents the sum\n> $$ x_m + x_{m+1} + x_{m+2} ... +x_{n-1} + x_n $$\n> \n> Where $i$ is the **index of summation**, $m$ is the **lower bound of summation**, $n$ is the **upper bound of summation**. \n\n> Properties of summation:\n> \n> Multiplying by a constant: \n> $$\\sum_{i=m}^n c*x_i = c\\sum_{i=m}^n x_i$$\n> Adding and subtracting sums:\n> $$\\sum_{i=m}^n x_i + \\sum_{i=m}^n y_i = \\sum_{i=m}^n (x_i + y_i)$$\n> $$\\sum_{i=m}^n x_i - \\sum_{i=m}^n y_i = \\sum_{i=m}^n (x_i - y_i)$$\n> Changing the bounds of the index of summation:\n> $$\\sum_{i=m}^n x_i = \\sum_{i=m+k}^{n+k} x_{i-k}$$\n\nProperty 1 and 2 show that summation is **linear**. The last property allows us to change the bounds of index of summation, which is useful for combining summation expressions.\n\n## Notation for Products\n> Definition [Product notation]:\n> $$\\prod_{i=m}^n x_i $$\n>\n> Represents the sum\n> $$ x_m * x_{m+1} * x_{m+2} ... * x_{n-1} * x_n $$\n> \n> Where $i$ is the **index of summation**, $m$ is the **lower bound of summation**, $n$ is the **upper bound of summation**. \n\n## Notation for Recurrence Relations\nA **recurrence relation** defines a sequence of values where each subsequent term depends on the value of the previous ones. \n\nExample: Fibonacci sequence is defined by $f_1 = 1, f_2 = 2, f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ for $n \\geq 3$. \n\n# Proof by induction\n## Induction\n> Axiom [principle of mathematical induction (POMI)]: \n> Let $P(n)$ be a statement that depends on $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$\n> s\n> If the following statements are both true:\n> 1. $P(1)$\n> 2.

For all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $P(n)$. \n\nThe POMI lets us prove universally quantified statements in the following way:\n> Proof method [induction]: \n> To prove the universally quantified statement \"For all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}, P(n)$\"\n> 1. Prove $P(1)$\n> 2. Prove the universally quantified implication \"For all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ if $P(k)$ then $P(k+1)$. \n\nThe implication $P(k) \\Longrightarrow P(k+1)$ is called the inductive step. The hypothesis of the implication is called the *inductive hypothesis*, and the conclusion is the *inductive conclusion*. \n\nGeneral format of an induction proof:\n**Base case**: Prove $P(1)$\n**Inductive step**: \n1. Assume $P(k)$ the inductive hypothesis. Write out the explicit statement of $P(k)$. \n2. Prove $P(k+1)$ using the assumption $P(k)$. Write out the explicit statement $P(k+1)$ before proving it.\n3. After proving $P(k+1)$, end the proof by stating that the result is true for $n=k+1$ and hence holds for all $n \\geq 1$ by the principle of mathematical induction. \n\n\n## Induction Example 1: Summation\nProve for every integer $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$,\n$$\n\\sum_{i = 1}^n i^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\n$$\n\nThe proof is by induction.\n\n**Base case**: We have $P(1)$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^1 i^2 = \\frac{1(1+1)(2*1+1)}{6}\n$$\n\nWe know\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^1 i^2 = 1^2 = 1\n$$\nand \n$$\n\\frac{1(1+1)(2*1+1)}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n$$\nSo the base case $P(1)$ is true. \n\n**Inductive step**: Assume the inductive hypothesis $P(k)$, that is, assume\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^k i^2 = \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}\n$$\n\nWe wish to prove $P(k+1)$ which is the statement:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}i^2 = \\frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)(2(k+1)+1)}{6}\n$$\nUsing summation properties and rearranging/factoring, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i = 1}^{k+1}i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^k i^2 + ((k+1)^2) \\\\\n= \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} + ((k+1)^2)  \\; \\; \\text{(from IH)} \\\\\n= \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1) + 6(k+1)^2}{6} \\\\ \n= \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)}{6} \\\\\n= \\frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)(2(k+1)+1)}{6}\n$$\nThe result is true for $n=k+1$ and thus holds for $n \\geq 1$ by POMI. \n\n## Induction example 2: reasoning with inequalities\nProve for all integers $n \\geq 3, n^2 > 2n + 1$. \n\n**Base case**: We have $P(3)$ is given by $3^2 > 2(3)+1$. We know $3^2 = 9$, $2(3)+1 = 7$, and $9 > 7$ which proves $P(3)$. \n\n**Inductive step**: Let $k$ be an integer such that $k \\geq 3$. Assume the IH, that is, $k^2>2k+1$. We wish to prove $P(k+1)$, which is the statement\n$$\n(k+1)^2 > 2(k+1)+1\n$$\nStarting with the expression on the left hand side of $P(k+1)$, we have\n$$\n(k+1)^2 = k^2+2k+1 > (2k+1) + (2k+1) \\geq 2k+1+7 > 2k+3 = 2(k+1)+1\n$$\nWhere the first $>$ follows from the IH and the $\\geq$ uses the fact that $2k+1 \\geq 7$ since $k \\geq 3$. \n\nThe result is thus true for $n=k+1$ and hence holds for $n \\geq 3$ by POMI. \n\n## Induction example 3: A recurrence relation that produces a square\nLet $a_0 = 0$ and define for a non-negative integer $n$, $a_{n+1} = a_n + 2n + 1$. Then $a_n = n^2$ for every integer $n$. \n**Base case:** Note that $a_0 = 0$ by definition. $0 = 0^2$ so the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive step**: Let $k \\in \\{0,1,2,...\\}$. Assume that $a_k = k^2$. By definition, we know $a_{k+1} = a_k + 2k + 1$. From our inductive hypothesis, we know:\n$$\na_k+2k+1 = k^2 + 2k + 1 \\\\\n= (k+1)^2\n$$\nTherefore, $a_{k+1} = (k+1)^2$. Hence $P(n)$ holds for all $n \\geq 0$ by the POMI. \n\n# Binomial Theorem\n\n> Definition [factorial]:\n> The **factorial** can be defined using product notation as such:\n> \n> $$ m! = \\prod_{i=1}^m i  $$\n> We define $0! = 1$. \n\n> Definition [binomial coefficient]:\n> We define the **binomial coefficient** for a non-negative integer $n$ and $m$ such that $m \\leq n$ as \n> $${n \\choose m} = \\frac{n!}{(n-m)!m!} $$\nIf $m > n$, we define ${n \\choose m} = 0$.\n\nExamples:\n1. ${n \\choose 0} = \\frac{n!}{n!0!} = 1$\n2. ${n \\choose 1} = \\frac{n!}{(n-1)!1!} = n$\n3. ${n \\choose 2} = \\frac{n!}{n-2)2!} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ (notice that this is the sum of the first $n$ integers!!!)\n4. ${7 \\choose 3} = \\frac{7!}{4!3!} = \\frac{7*6*5}{3!} = 35$\n\n## Pascal's identity\nPascal's identity is a recurrence that is used to prove the Binomial Theorem. \n> Proposition [Pascal's identity]:\n> For positive integers $n$ and $m$ with $m < n$,\n> $$ {n \\choose m} = { n-1 \\choose m - 1 } + {n - 1 \\choose m}$$\n\nPascal's identity can be proved by using the identities and showing they are equivalent: \n$$\n{n -1 \\choose m} = \\frac{(n-1)!}{(n-1-m)!m!} \\\\\n{n - 1 \\choose m - 1 } = \\frac{(n-1)!}{(n-1-m)!m!} \\\\\n{n \\choose m } = \\frac{n!}{(n-m)!m!}\n$$\n\n## Binomial Theorem I\n> Theorem [Binomial Theorem I]:\n> \n> For all integers $n \\geq 0$ and all real numbers $x$,\n> $$ (1+x)^n = \\sum_{m=0}^n {n \\choose m}x^m\n\nIts proof is inductive.\n\n## Binomial Theorem II\n> Theorem [Binomial Theorem II]:\n> \n> For all integers $n \\geq 0$ and all real numbers $a$ and $b$,\n> $$ (a+b)^n = \\sum_{m=0}^n {n \\choose m}a^{n-m}b^m\n\nIts proof follows from factoring out $a$ and applying Binomial Theorem I on $a(1+\\frac{a}{b})$.\n\n\n\n# 4.4 Proof By Strong Induction\n> Axiom [Principle of Strong induction (POSI)]:\n> \n> Let $P(n)$ be a statement that depends on $n \\in \\mathbb N$\n> If statements 1 and 2 of the below are both true:\n>\n> 1. $P(1)$\n> 2.

Assume the inductive hypothesis $P(1) \\wedge P(2) \\wedge \\dots P(k)$. \n\nWe wish to prove $P(k+1)$, which is the statement \"The positive integer $k+1$ is odd or even, and we prove the inductive conclusion separately for these two cases.\n\n**Case 1**: Suppose $k+1$ is odd. Then by the inductive hypothesis, $k$ is the sum of non negative integer powers of $2$. Since $k$ is even, its sum cannot include $2^0$ since it is the only power of $2$ that is odd. By adding $2^0$ to this sum, we obtain $k+1$ is a sum of distinct integer powers of $2$, so $P(k+1)$ holds.\n\n**Case 2**: Suppose $k+1$ is even. $(k+1)/2$ is an even integer and less than $k+1$, so by the inductive hypothesis, we have $(k+1)/2$ is the sum of distinct non-negative integer powers of $2$. If we multiply every term in the sum by $2$, then the poewrs are all increasd by $1$, so they remain distinct and positive. Now, the sum of these distinct integer powers of $2$ is twice the original sum, or $2*(k+1)/2 = k+1$ which proves $P(k+1)$ in this case.\n\nThe result holds for $n=k+1$, hence holds for $n \\geq 1$ by POSI. \n\n# 5.0 Introduction to Sets\nLet $\\emptyset$ denote the **empty set**.

Does $[5]$ have a multiplicative inverse in $Z_{10}$? **No**, because $gcd(5,10) = 5 \\neq 1$.\n\n2. Solve $[5][x] = [4]$ in $Z_{12}$. \n\nSolution: Since $gcd(5,12) = 1$, the multiplicative inverse $[5]^{-1}$ exists and is unique. By observation, we find $[5][5] = [25] = [1]$ in $Z_{12}$. Hence we have $[5]^{-1} = [5]$. \n\nMultiplying both sides of $[5][x] = [4]$ by $[5]^{-1}$ we get\n$$[x] = [5]^{-1}[4] = [20] = [8]$$\nTherefore, $[5][x] = [4]$ has one solution $[x] = [8]$ in $Z_{12}$. \n\n\n# 8.7 Fermat's Little Theorem\n> Theorem [Fermat's Little Theorem F$l$t]: For all prime numbers $p$ and integers $a$ not divisible by $p$, we have\n> $$a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$$\n\n> Corollary: For all prime numbers $p$ and integers $a$, we have\n> $$a^p \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$$\n\nWhen applying FLT, it is important to consider the two cases $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ and $x \\neq 0 \\pmod{p}$. \n\n# Chinese Remainder Theorem\n> Theorem [Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)]: For all integers $a_1$ and $a_2$ and positive integers $m_1$ and $m_2$, if $gcd(m_1,m_2)=1$ then the simulataneous linear congruences\n> $$n\\equiv a_1 \\pmod{m_1}$$\n> $$n \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{m_2}$$\n> have a uniue solution modulo $m_1m_2$.
