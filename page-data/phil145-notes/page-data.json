That’s because sustained use of marijuana worsens a person’s memory, and nothing that adversely affects one’s mental abilities should be legalized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>conclusion</strong>: Marijuana should not be legalized.</p>\n<p>The <strong>premises</strong>: The reasons for the claim (e.g. worsens memory, etc)</p>\n<h3>What is an argument?</h3>\n<p>An argument is: a set of claims in which one or more of these claims support another claim - the conclusion.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are no international police. It takes police to thoroughly enforce the law. Therefore, international law cannot be thoroughly enforced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can identify <strong>two premises</strong> and <strong>one conclusion</strong>.

This is where you need to find your own sense of context and logic.
