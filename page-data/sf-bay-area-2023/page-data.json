From my experience this is pretty unusual, as most companies sponsor a J1 visa instead for internships. The main difference is that for a TN visa, you must complete an interview with a CBP officer at the port of entry (e.g. the immigration area of an airport), and you must pay a $50 USD processing fee if the application is successful. For a J1 visa, the fees are paid by the company, and at immigration you hand the CBP officer a form (DS-2019) and simply head along your way. The TN application is adjudicated by the CBP officer on the spot, and there's a very real risk of being denied.</p>\n<p>Immigration lawyers said that YVR has the highest rate of success for applying for a TN visa, so instead of taking a direct flight from Toronto to SFO, I flew from Toronto to Vancouver, with a ~5 hour layover then to SFO.</p>\n<p>Since I had a couple hours layover in YVR, I decided to exit the airport and walk around a bit. I took the Skytrain to the harbor front (Canada Place).  </p>\n<p>The TN interview was simple - the officer simply asked my major and where I would be staying in the US and approved my application. However I had to wait ~1 hour, so I would definitely recommend arriving early or else you risk missing your flight.</p>\n<h1 id=\"milpitas\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#milpitas\" aria-label=\"milpitas permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Milpitas</h1>\n<p>Will continue when I have more time ... </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"San Francisco Bay Area - Summer 2023","url":"sf-bay-area-2023"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/sf-bay-area-2023/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["4188439704"]}
