In November 2024, I visited 12 European cities in 28 days. It was a loop around central Europe, done entirely by train.

## Scams and strange interactions

I saw a lot of scams on this trip. Because I've lived in North America most of my life, I was really surprised and didn't really know about much of them prior to this trip.

**Paris (Eiffel Tower, Montmartre):**
- Petition: An individual walking around with a clipboard (all women in my experience) would approach you and ask if you can sign a petition. Afterwards, they would pressure you to donate money. Or they'll use the petition as a distraction to pickpocket you.

- Cup game: A group of people would play a game with three cups and a ball on the street. To make the game seem legitimate or attention-grabbing they have many participants all watching the game. They would ask you to bet massive amounts of money on where the ball is. It's rigged of course.


**On intercity trains in Italy:**
- Individuals leave a note on your table that describes their dire situation and asks for money, later coming back to collect it. How are they able to print so many of these notes? Seems suspicious and more like organized crime than begging. I refused to give anything. Make sure to secure your belongings (e.g. phones on tables) as they may attempt to steal them if you refuse.

**Budapest (Fisherman's Bastion):**
- A lady with many birds (chickens) tries to catch your attention. I didn't see the rest of it play out, but presumably she and an accomplice would put the bird on you, take photos, and try to pressure you to pay an exorbitant amount for the photos.

**Hostels and restaurants, especially in Italy:**
- I would get asked to pay in cash because "the card machine is broken". They just want to avoid taxes. If you insist on paying by card, the card machine will magically start working again. Many places in North America advertise a cash discount or cash only for similar tax avoidance, but at least they don't give a dishonest reason for it.

Two common themes of these scams is that they occur in touristy areas and they try to do something that catches your attention. If it seems anything remotely out of place and it is not what you came for, then ignore it.


## Equipment
I carried a backpack and a gym/duffel bag which stored around 5 days of clothes. This made it easy to move around cities and take transit instead of lugging around a suitcase.


## School

I was able to do this trip while I was finishing up my last term. I chose all asynchronous online courses and made sure that they did not have timed assessment. This meant essay / writing-heavy courses worked well. The courses I took were CLAS 201 (Ancient Greece), PHIL 256 (Cognitive Science), and GEOG 225 (Global Health and Environment). 


## Trip planning

In many cities, we only spent two nights, which is really just one and a half days when taking into account train travel (often arriving in the afternoon) and checking into the hotel. Because of this, it felt a little rushed near the end of the trip, especially the Berlin and Amsterdam (and return to Paris) segments. Two nights is really quite short for such major cities and the train travel can get exhausting. However, I don't regret it as I was able to get a sample of many different cities and learn about what I liked and didn't like.
