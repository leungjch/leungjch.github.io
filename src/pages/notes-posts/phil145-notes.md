> Definition [Argument]: An attempt by a person to persuade someone on a topic

Skills to learn taking this course:
- Understand arguments
	- Understanding theses and arguments in a large book stem from the same day-to-day arguments we see
	- There are many forms of arguments
- Evaluate arguments
	- When is an argument good and when should I be persuaded?

Critical thinking is important not only in day-to-day life, but also in academic environments.

The first half of the course: 
- What is a good argument? 
- What is a structure of an argument?
	- Diagramming arguments
	- Grouping of arguments (e.g. inductive and deductive arguments)
- What conditions must an argument meet to be a good argument? 
- What are different types of falllacies? When is an argument fallacious?

3 lectures on formal logic and scientific reasoning 
- Formal logic: the study of valid forms of argument
	- Formal logic has much relevance in fields like computer science or linguistics
	- Abstracting away the content of an argument and identifying its general form
		- Investigating the content of the argument
		- Investigating how well the reasons link to the conclusion


- Scientific claims
	- Conflicts of interest and bias (industry funded research, experimenter bias, pressure to publish, methodological errors)
	- Evaluating shocking claims (carcinogenic foods)
	- Important for living in a scientific / technological society


## Instructions on consuming course material
Lecture notes may contain different content from the taped lectures, which may be different from the textbook. **Therefoore, consume the lecture, notes, and textbook**.


**Surface read textbook and try questions $\rightarrow$ read lecture notes $\rightarrow$ listen to lecture $\rightarrow$ re-read the textbook and notes, aiming for full understanding**

# Week 2 Sat 12 Sep 2020 

## Textbook Chapter 1 - What is an Argument?
An **argument** offers reasons and evidence to persuade others that a belief is correct.

Consider the short argument:
> Marijuana should not be legalized. That’s because sustained use of marijuana worsens a person’s memory, and nothing that adversely affects one’s mental abilities should be legalized.


The **conclusion**: Marijuana should not be legalized.

The **premises**: The reasons for the claim (e.g. worsens memory, etc)

### What is an argument?
An argument is: a set of claims in which one or more of these claims support another claim - the conclusion.

Example:
> There are no international police. It takes police to thoroughly enforce the law. Therefore, international law cannot be thoroughly enforced.

We can identify **two premises** and **one conclusion**. We can see this clearly as a list of statements:
> 1. There are no international police
> 2. It takes police to enforce the law.
>
> *Therefore*
>
> 3. International law cannot be enforced

The general structure of an argument goes as such:
1. Premise 1
2. Premise 2
3. Premise 3.
4. Premise $n$
5. Therefore,
6. Conclusion

### Argument and opinion
> Definition [Opinion]: A belief, often hold with low degree of confidence.

It is commonly said "you are entitled to your own opinion", but not all opinions are equal in terms of validity and correctness.

### Argument and Indicator Words
Rene Descartes's famous argument:
> 1. I think
>
> Therefore
>
> 2. I exist.

Idea of Descartes's argument - what can a person doubt and what cannot a person doubt? Doubting involves thinking, which only possible if the person who is thinking exists.

**Indicator words**: Suggest the presence of an argument and indicate structure. Which statements are premises, conclusions, etc
Example indicator words: 
- *since* and *because* and *as indicated by* precede a premise
- *therefore* comes before the conclusion of an argument.

Indicator words in use:
> The Giants will likely beat the Trojans this year, **because** Swanson is such a strong addition to the team.
> 
> Universities need to have faculty who will do research, **since** research is necessary and there are few other institutions that support it.

Example **premise indicators**:
- since
- because
- for
- follows from
- given that
- as shown by

Example **conclusion indicators**:
- therefore
- thus
- so
- consequently
- it follows that
- in conclusion
- shows that

### Where and how do you find arguments?
Not every argument contains indicator words. This is where you need to find your own sense of context and logic. Also try to split an argument into two people arguing opposite sides of a point to try to find the conclusion that the arguer is trying to make.

Questions to ask yourself when encountering a passage/speech:
- What would be the conclusion if it had an argument?
- What is the fundamental point? What is being claimed?
- Are questions of justification being considered?
- Is a claim being disputed?

### What isnt an argument?
Statements can be neither premises or conclusions: 
- Questions
- Describing events and problems
- Explaining occurrences
- Telling jokes
- Storytelling

Examples of the above:
- 49/7 = 7
- I cant stand broccoli!
- What are the causes of juvenile delinquency?
- It was a crisp and frosty September morning, but so many problems occupied their minds that the beauty of the day went unappreciated.
**None of the above express arguments.**

> Definition [conditional statement]: Describes two or more conditions and specifies that *if* a condition hold, *then* another will as well. A conditional statement is not an argument.


> Definition [nonargument]: A passage/text/speech that does not contain an argument (i.e. contains any of the elements of the list above.

## Lecture 2 Notes
> Definition [Argument]: An argument is a set of declarative sentences, one of which is designated to be the conclusion and the rest of which are the premises. The premises are supposed to support the conclusion.

- In this definition, all premises are treated the same and there is only one conclusion. In reality, there are *subconclusions* and *subarguments* that form the entire argument.

- An argument is a **set of declarative sentences.**


**Principle of charity**: Interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible (*giving the benefit of the doubt*). I.e. assume that the authoor is intelligent and is makking a strong case. 

**Recognizing arguments:** The crucial thing to decide is whether the author is trying to show that a claim is true, or whether instead she is trying to answer the question of *Why something happened* or *Why something is the way it is*.	- I.e. describing things and answering whhy thhings happened is not an argument.


## Lecture 2
What is an argument?
> A set of declarative sentences, one of which is the conclusion and the rest are premises.
Justification for this definition:
- Has advantage of being more abstract (removes ambiguity of what happens when two arguments are presented to others at the same time by two people)
- A person can make a bad argument and could've made a better one, this definition captures that.
How to tell if a person is presenting an argument or not?

Questions
- "Are you listening?" is not an argument or statement
- Equivalent to "Listen up" 
- **Exception:** Rhetorical questions can be a declarative sentence. In this case, translate the rhetorical question into the declarative sentence.

Not part of an argument:
- examples supporting the premises
- explaining the premise

**Signposting**: Explaining one's purposes and intentions in writing.
Indicators are signposts. 
- "It has to be true that x because y and z".
	- **It has to be true** - conclusion indicator
	- **"because** - premise indicator

- Subarguments
	- Contains subconclusions that are the premises of the bigger argument

Steps in understanding an argument (and if it is one):
- Identify the conclusion first
	- Allows you to be **charitable** in understanding their premises
Explanations are not arguments
- If an author is explaining why something happened, then it is an explanation, not an argument.

# Week 3
## Textbook Chapter 2 "Pinning Down Argument Structure" (p.22 to p.46)
The structure of an argument:
- Different ways that premises can support conclusions
- How arguments are stated


We must understand an argument before evaluating it to judge it properly.

### Standardizing arguments
1. 1 Premise 1
2.  2 Premise 2
3. 3 Premise N
Therefore
4. 4 Conclusion

We can use this approach to refer to premises by their number **Premise (1)** or **(1)** , and "the author uses statements **(1), (2), and (N)** to support statement **(4)**.

Example:
> It may be that the general manager takes a very dim view of your group and has turned you down before. Should you try to approach the head office directly? In most cases the answer is no because the people at the head office are going to be very, very reluctant to go over the head of the local manager on a local matter. In fact, the head office might well send such a letter back to the general manager to draft a reply! Then the general manager will take an even dimmer view of your group.

Standardized example:
1. The local manager may likely have a dim view of your group.
2. The head office is reluctant to work against the local manager on a local issue.
3. The head office may send a letter to the local office to draft a reply back, who is already not in favour of your group

Therefore,

4. You should not approach the head office after being turned down by the local office.

Diagrammed below:
![2_2](img/2_1.png)

### Subarguments
> Definition [subargument]: A subargument is given to support/defend a premise, which is a component of the **whole argument**.

#### Ex 1 (no subarguments)
Example argument containing subargument:

> A computer cannot cheat in a game, because cheating requires deliberately breaking rules in order to win. A computer cannot deliberately break rules because it has no freedom of action.

Standardized argument:
1. A computer has no freedom of action.

Thus,

2. A computer cannot deliberately break the rules.
3. Cheating requires deliberately breaking rules to win.

Therefore,

4. A computer cannot cheat in a game.

The word **because** in the passage helps identify a subargument.

Diagrammed:

![2_2](img/2_2.png)

#### Ex 2 (1 subargument + 1 main premise)
Ex. argument 2:

> The purpose of life in general is not something that can be known. That’s because every life has a different purpose, given to it by the person leading that life. Only the person leading a life can give it a purpose.

Ex. standardized 2:

1. Only the person leading a life can give it a purpose

Thus,

2. Every life has a different purpose, given tto it by the person leading that life.

Therefore,

3. The purpose of life in general is not something that can be known.

Ex 2 diagrammed:

![2_3](img/2_3.png)

The conclusion is supported by a subargument, which is supported by one premise

#### Ex 3 (1 premise establishes two conclusions)

Ex. argument 3:

> Labor is the basis of all property. From this it follows that a man owns what he makes by his own hands and the man who does not labor has no rightful property. 

Ex standardized 3:

1. Labor is the basis of all property.

Therefore,

2. A man owns what he makes by his own hands.

and

1. Labor is the basis of all property.

Therefore,

3. A man who does not labor has no rightful property.

Ex 3 diagrammed:
![2_4](img/2_4.png)

Argument has a **divergent** structure. Prefer the structure on the left as it's more compact. 


#### Identifying unnecessary sentences in a passage
An author may explain others' views to set the context, insert personal comments ("it's shocking", "it has amazed me that..."), introducing the topic / defining terms. 

**These are not premises or conclusions, so do not belong in standardization**.


#### Ex 4 (two premises with unnecessary filler)
Ex argument 4:

> It just disgusts me how many people are willing to stick with science and ignore all the spiritual aspects of life. This is a sad feature of our times—and by the way, it reminds me a little of the ancient Romans, who lived in a very corrupt time. Here’s what they said about the emperor Nero, one of the late Roman emperors. He fiddled while Rome burned—that was it. Well anyway, the point I want to make here is that science does not provide a ufficient guide for human life, because it does not provide us with values. We need values to live our lives by. 

Ex argument 4 standardized:

1. Science does not provide us with values.
2. We need values to live our lives by.

Therefore,

3. Science does not provide us with a sufficient guide for human life.

The filler about Nero and the ancient Romans is unnecessary and only for emotional value. Notice how little of the argument remains when it is taken out.

Ex 4 diagrammed:


![2_5](img/2_5.png)

#### Ex 5 (multiple subarguments supporting one premise)

Ex 5 argument:
> Descartes was a philosopher who lived in the seventeenth century at a time when there were a lot of religious wars and the Inquisition was still functioning. He was a sincere Catholic but he was nevertheless afraid that some of his philosophical ideas would not be orthodox enough for the Catholic church. He went to live in Holland in a Dutch town called Egmont—which, strangely enough, still has no museum about Descartes and his work and life. Really, they should have one, and it’s odd that they don’t, given how much the Dutch people love museums. Descartes had a lot of influence in the history of ideas. He influenced Spinoza and Leibniz. He influenced Locke, who disagreed with him. And he set a trend of thinking for oneself which has been hugely important. So there should be a museum for Descartes in Holland. 

Ex 5 standardized:
1. Descartes influenced the rationalist tradition developed by Spinoza and Leibniz.
2. Descartes influenced Locke, who disagreed with him.
3. Descartes set a trend of thinking for oneself.

Thus,

4. Descartes had a profound influence on the history of western thought.

Therefore,

5. There should be a museum for Descartes in Holland.


Ex 5 diagrammed:

![2_8](img/2_8.png)

### How to standardize arguments
1. Read passage multiple times
2. Confirm that an argument exists (if the author is supporting a position with claims in its defense)
3. Identify conclusion, premises, any subarguments
4. Omit side comments, backkground information
5. Omit repetition of material
6. Omit personal phrases (in my opinion, I am concerned that). These are indicators of how the author feels about what they are saying.
7. Number each premise and conclusion
8. Check that each premise contains a complete statement
9. Check that no premise or a conclusion itself is an argument (i.e. can be split further). E.g. the sentence "the party will do poorly because the leader has made mistakes" must be broken down into premise (1) "the leader has made mistakes" and conclusion (2) "therefore the party will do poorly".
10. Check passage if any detail was missed.

### Exercise set 1
1. 
	1. A car with reliable brakes should have brakkes that work in wet weather.
	2. The breaks on my car don't work well in wet weather.

	Therefore
	
	3. My car does not have reliable brakes.

	
3.  
   1. Unemployment among youth is correlated with higher gang violence.

   Thus,

   2. Unemployment is a major cause of disruptions.

   Therefore,

   3. Gang violence is not caused by drugs.
5. 	1. Every religion I studied incorporates bias against women.

	Therefore,
	
	2. All religions I've studied incorporate bias against women.

### Tools for understanding arguments (location, scope, commitment)
#### Location of conclusions
Conclusions can be placed in thhe beginning, middle, and end. They can appear multiple times at both the beginning and end for emphasis.

**Rhetorical questions**: Conclusions may take the form of rhetorical questions (questions to make a point). E.x. "How can we manage without books?" $\rightarrow$ "We cannot manage without books".

**Imperative structure**: A command-like sentence. "Don't trust this stuff." $\rightarrow$ "New technology should not be trusted.

#### Scope (quantifiers)
- All dance students have a good sense of rhythm.
- Most dance students have a good sense of rhythm.
- Many dance students have a good sense of rhythm.
- Some dance students have a good sense of rhythm.
- A few dance students have a good sense of rhythm.
- At least one dance student has a good sense of rhythm.
- No dance student has a good sense of rhythm.

To refute the first **universal** claim, it suffices to provide one counterexample (a dance student with a bad sense of rhythm), vice versa for last.

#### Commitment
**Degree of commitment**: The sureness or tentativeness of the statement - "our team will win" vs "our team might win"

#### Patterns in arguments
**Linked support**: A set of premises that depend on each other. 

Example:
1. Vulnerability to heart disease is inherited or environmental.
2. Vulnerability ot heart disease is not environmental.

Therefore,

3. Vulnerability to heart disease is inherited.

Its diagram:

![2_5](img/2_5.png)

Another example:
1. Athletes get plenty of exercise.
2. Exercise keeps a person healthy.
3. Healthy people will live a long life.

Therefore,

4. Athletes will lead a long life.

Its diagram:
![2_11](img/2_11.png)

**Convergent support**: Opposite of linked support. Premises are unlinked, not interdependent. Each premise supports the conclusion on its own.

Example:

1. Setting aside apartments for adults and keeping out children discriminates against
people with children.
2. Setting aside apartments for adults and keeping out children encourages single, child-less people to pursue an overly selfish lifestyle.

Therefore,

3. Apartments should not keep children out.

Its diagram:
![2_12](img/2_12.png)


Patterns can be combined. For example, an argument with two premises (4) (5) that link to a main conclusion (6). Premise (4) is supported by (1) in a **linear** arangement, and Premise (5) is supported by (2) and (3) in a **convergent** arangement.

### Exercise set 2
2.
4.
7.

### Unstated Premises and Conclusions
#### Unstated Premises
An argument may contain missing/unstated premises - a logical gap.

Example:
> In fact, the ordinary orange is a miniature chemical factory. And the good old potato contains arsenic among its more than 150 ingredients. This doesn’t mean natural foods are dangerous. If they were, they wouldn’t be on the market.

This argument is missing a premise:
1. If natural foods such as potatoes and oranges were dangerous, they would not be on the market.

3. ** **Natural foods such as potatos and oranges are on the market.**

So,

2. Natural foods such as potatoes and oranges are not dangerous.

Its diagram (**3**) is underlined because it is unstated:
![2_14](img/2_14.png)

Guidelines for missing premises:
1. There is a logical gap in the argument
2. The logical gap can be filled by inserting an additional premise.
3. This premise is something that the arguer accepts or something that the arguer is commited to.
4. Statements inserted as missing premises should be plausible as possible.

**Strawman fallacy**: Misinterpreting the argument, possibly from filling in a missing premise incorrectly.

Lecture notes
## Lecture 4
**Linked support**: Taken together, these premises support a conclusion, but taken individually, they cannot support the conclusion by themselves.

**Convergent support**: Each premise can properly support the conclusion.

**Antipremises/rebuttals**: Statements that make the argument less true. 

**Antipremise**: Drawn with a wavy line to the conclusion

**Rebuttal**: Arrow with a circle



## Lecture 5


## Lecture 6 
### Evaluating arguments
Claim in an argument: All of my premises are true. My conclusion is supported by the premises.

Problems with arguments:
1. Problem with premises
   
2. Conclusion is not supported by the premises

**Validity**: Argument is deductively valid if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.

Arguments can be **valid**, but statements (conclusions and premises can only be **true** or **false**)

An argument can be valid even if its premises are false. "Dogs are cats" and "cats are mammals" then "dogs are mammals". This argument is valid

**Sound**: Premises are true and argument is **valid**. This type of arguments is too strong since we don't know if premises are true.

Instead, ask **is it reasonable to believe the premise is true?**


**Cogent argumment**:  An argument whose acceptable premises provide sufficient support for the conclusion. 

### ARG Conditions
**Acceptability**: A premise is acceptable if it is reasonable to think that the premise is true.
- For each premise: Is this premise reasonable to accept?

**G and R**: How strong of a link do the premises provide to the conclusion?

**Relevance**: 
- Not necessary to consider - you can think it's met if you like. 
- Take each premise and ask - does this premise (including its linked support premises) supply any support for the conclusion
  
**Grounds**: 
- If an argument is **valid**, this condition is automatically met. 
- Do the premises as a whole provide sufficient support? (consider like linked support)

If an argument meets **ARG**, it may not be cogent.
  
How to use the **ARG** conditions? 
1. Which of the premises are acceptable? 
2. Is the argument valid?
   1. If valid, **R** and **G** conditions are met
   2. Then eliminate all the premises that do not satisfy **A** condition
   3. If still valid, argument is cogent. 
   4. If not, move to next step
3. We have an argument is not valid
4. Which premises are relevant and which are not?

Good arguments give good reason to believe something, but bad arguments **do not** provide reason to disbelieve something. 

# Lecture 7
Analysis of argument

Evaluation of argument

Problems with language: 
- Fallacy of equivocation saying two things that are different are the same
  - May fail the **A** condition because it's impossible that both premises are true.
  - May fail the **G** condition since the conclusion does not follow from the premises when they are interpreted differently as they should be. 

- Ambiguity: Something that has more than one distinct meaning

- Vagueness: A characteristic of a meaning - "red" can have different shades, "tall" is subjective 
	- Makes it difficult to evaluate the acceptabilty of an argument
  

- Emotional impact:
    - Pejorative/emotionally charged: Insults, etc 
	- Euphemism: A phrase used to deliberately hide the severity of something - "Collateral damage" is euphemistic for "Civilian casualities"

- Definitions:
  - Persuasive definition: A definition that is not accurate and twisted to appeal to the person's argument, and a more well-accepted definition already exists.

# Lecture 8: Acceptability of Conditions
## Acceptability of a condition
- Was the premise acceptable for you?
- We might not know if a premise is acceptable or not, but we can assign a confidence percentage to it
  
### A list of acceptability conditions:
- When a cogent argument has been made for the condition
- When a ground truth is presented and it is obvious why it is true "all bachelors are unmarried", "every integer is odd or even" 
- When something is common knowledge
- Something is being testified by someone
  - Is this a subject matter in which an expert testimony is required? E.g. "expert testimony" in political science is controversial in comparison to polymer chemistry
  - External factors of the person testifying - if they are biased (funded by a group) or have had a record of lying 
- Conditional statements ("suppose that Hitler escaped to Brazil"), it's not necessarily true that hypothesis is true, but accept them for the sake of argument, i.e. "accepting a premise provisionally"  
### A list of conditions to reject a premise:
- Inconsistent premises:
  -  where it is impossible for premises to all be possible at the same time: "All humans are carnivores" and "All humans are vegetarians"
  -  At least one premise has to be false
- Premises that are vague or unclear:
  - Cannot know what claim is made
  - Cannot accept what cannot be understood

- A premise is controversial or presupposes a controversial premise
- Arguments that beg the question (circular) - presuppose the truth of the conclusion. 
  - An argument can be circular and valid: "If ducks have feathers then ducks have feathers". 


# Lecture 9: Relevance Condition
Irrelevant premises may be intentionally placed to distract from the argument 

Relevance: Does the premise give any reason to think that the conclusion is true? 

A premise is **Positively Relevant** if it helps make the conclusion true, and **Negatively Relevant** if it helps make the conclusion false. 

If all premises are irrelevant, then the argument fails the **grounds** condition.

### Diversionary Fallacies:
- **Red herring**: A premise which is not relevant to the argument and is meant to distract the person listening to the argument. This is an umbrella term that covers all of the below fallacies. 
- **Strawman fallacy**: Instead of responding to the arguer's position, address a weaker version of it
- **Ad Hominem**: Attacking the arguer itself instead of the argument ("he's just a communist"). Exception - pointing out when the arguer has a conflict of interest (funded by industry, etc)
- **Guilt by association**: Associating a view of the arguer with a group of other people thought to be wrong/bad. E.g. "thats what the communists thought". 
- Ad populum ("50 million frenchmen can't be wrong"): Appealing to a popular view

# Lecture 10: Formal Logic Part 1
Two systems of logic: SL (Sentential logic) and PL

Consistent: A set of sentences is **consistent** if all of them **can** be true at the same time - e.g. door is open and shut at the same time is not consistent

Valid arguments may have false premises

Logically true: Something that must always be true. "1 is odd" is a logically true statement. 

Contingent: A sentence that may be true or false. 

## Binary connectives (SL):
AND: True only if both are true

OR: True if either is true

NEGATION: False if A is true, True if A is false. 

# Lecture 11

Natural deduction system


## Dead reckoning
Analogous to truth tables

Used to show **invalidity** in an argument

## Proof theory of SL
- Sentence for each premise
- Number each sentence
- **Repetition**: "(2), repetition" 
- **AND**: "m, n & introduction" 

Implication rules

- Modus Ponens: "m, n, -> modus ponens"
- Conditional proof: Make assumption on one line, indent on newline
  
Negation rules:

- Contradiction (Reductio argument): Assume it is true and show it is absurd: Prove A and not A is true 
- Double negation: Negation of a negation of A is the same as A. 

OR rules:
- if A is true, then A or B is true regardless of B
- Constructive dilemma: 

## Disproving arguments in SL
Dead reckoning: List the premises with the conclusion at the end. 

Ask yourself: How can it be true that the premises are true and the conclusion is false? 

Then ask yourself: What does it mean for each premise to be true?
- If A and B true, then A and B are both true
- Disproving implications A=>B: Assume A true and B is false. A=>B is only true when hypothesis is false or conclusion is true. 

# Lecture 12 Predicate Logic (PL)
Why do we need PL? PL is stronger

"Bob has blonde hair therefore someone has blonde hair" in SL is: B therefore S which is not valid

Problem with SL: Simple declarative sentences

Singular term: Something that refers to one object 

Predicate: Declarative sentence. In the sentence "bob has blonde hair", the predicate is "x has blonde hair". We can now replace x with other singular terms. 

**Capital letters refer to predicates** 

**Small letters refer to singular terms**.

Example: P x refers to the predicate P with singular term x. 

B x: x has blonde hair

Universal quantifier $\forall$

Existential quantifier $\exists$ 

Universe of discourse (UD): The things we are talking about

## Example
UD: People. 

B b. 

Therefore,

$\exists$ x,  B x  (there exists a blonde person). 


## Negation of quantifiers
Negation of "all dogs bark" is "not all dogs bark" which means "there exists one non-barking dog". **This is different from "all dogs are non-barkers".**

Square of opposition: Listing A, O, E, I in a diagonal

If something is valid in SL, then it's probably valid. But if not valid in SL, it's not necessarily invalid

PL is stronger, so an invalid argument in PL is more likely to be invalid
# Lecture 13 Correlations
Example correlation claim: "Married men are more likely than unmarried men to live past age 70"

Correlation claims have:
1. Population: The group of things
2. Values of two variables of the population: 
   1. A variable is something that all population members have but have at least two values. The variables are marital status (values: married/unmarried) and longevity (values: living past 70/not living past 70)

## Random sampling
Randomness is desirable in order to make claims about a population. 

## Margin of error
The higher sample size, the lower the margin of error and the more confident we can be that the estimation is within some small percentage of the true value. 

# Lecture 14 Induction and Scientific Reasoning - Causal Claims

## What is a causal claim? 
A correlation: A higher pecentage of X than non-X have P. 

Causal claim: If certain changes were made, then the world would be different. 

Positive causal factor: Increase of X leads to increase of Y
Negative causal factor: Increase of X leads to decrease of Y. 

# Lecture 16 Argument by Analogy
Primary subject: Which subject matter is the one that I am supposed to conclude something about?

Analogue: The thing that is similar to the primary subject.

Argument by analogy: The analogue have some certain features that the primary subject also has. But the analogue has some other features too, so we should infer that the primary subject has that feature. 

Analogue subject should be well understood. 

## Problems with analogy
- False premise
  - Analogue or primary subject do not have the purported qualities
  - Equivocations: failing to notice that the word is used with different meanings
- Unstated premise: 
  - Ask yourself: Are these sufficient for the two subjects to be similar enough? Any obvious dissimilarities to make it inappropriate?

- Fallacy of faulty analogy
  - analogue and primary subject are too dissimilar

## Types of analogies
- Inductive analogies
  - Examples: Animal studies of substances to conclude effects on humans
  - Problem: Human beings are different from rats 
  - Problem: Dosages are too high and unrepresentative of human dosage
  - Counterclaim to first problem: Consider cancer substances causing in humans and rats. Furthermore, consider that these cancer substances were found in rats first. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that cancer substances in rats cause cancer in humans. (Inductive/scientific evidence)
  - Counterclaim to second problem: Assumption of proportionality of dosages holds in most substances. Higher doses make it likelier to get statistically significant differences in effect in a smaller sample size. 
- Consistentcy analogies
- Used where prescedent is important (e.g. legal cases)
- Treat the analogy and the subject in the same way
- Potential problems: The shared properties between primary and analogue are not the same / insufficient / irrelevant. 
- Problems:
  - Two wrongs fallacy: Analog is wrong, primary subject is okay, but treat them the same
  - Slippery prescedent argument: If we accept this argument, then we need to accept a lot of other illegitimate claims.

## Conductive Arguments
Conductive / balanced considerations argument: An argument considering a lot of pros and cons. 

Diagramming: A convergent argument with considerations for conclusion, and counterconsiderations (squiggly lines)

Need to consider:

Acceptable? Are the premises reliable / true?

Relevant? Any red herrings?

Conductive arguments are non valid. 

Does this counterconsideration provide proof against the conclusion?

Are there any other relevant considerations?

In a deductive (valid) argument, new information does not change the conclusion. 

In a conductive (non valid) argument, new information can change the balance of an argument. 

Valid argument are also known as monotonic arguments.

Scientific evidence is not really relevant in matters of public policy because there are also other considerations of morality/ethics. Furthermore, arguments in public policy are not really deductively valid.
