    summary: <p> I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. I previously worked at <a href="https://sail.cs.queensu.ca/">Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab (SAIL)</a>, where I applied traditional machine learning techniques to provide insights to software engineering. I love programming unique and novel solutions to a variety of domains - take a look at the <a href="#work">work</a> and <a href="#projects">projects</a> I've done throughout the years.
