    summary: <p> I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. I previously worked at Queen's University Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab (SAIL), where I applied traditional machine learning techniques to provide insights to software engineering. Programming is a passion of mine - don't take my word for it, take a look at the <a href="#work">work</a> and <a href="#projects">projects</a> I've done throughout the years. In my spare time, I enjoy exercising, reading, and cooking. </p>
