    - name: "Cookie or Donut Neural Network"
      description: "A vanilla neural network that classifies a doodle (a 256x256 grayscale bitmap) as a cookie, a donut, or neither. Trained using backpropagation algorithm on doodles from Google Quick, Draw! dataset (~1M images). Runs on Android. Neural network implemented from scratch using Numpy linear algebra module, weights transferred to a Java implementation of a prediction-only neural network I made using the ojAlgo library."

    - name: DIY VR Styrofoam Headset
      description: "A VR headset built from scratch. Head tracking was done using the MPU-6050 gyroscope and accelerometer sensor (~$30), which is sent to the Arduino Micro and converted into mouse input. Fully compatible with all SteamVR games. The headset display is my phone, which streams video my desktop."
